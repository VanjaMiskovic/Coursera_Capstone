It is often called the most investment-friendly, and most-popular-for-work city. Around 36.7% of people who live in London are foreign-born which makes London the second city in the world by immigration population, right after New York City. \nLondon has a diverse range of people and cultures, and more than 300 languages are spoken in the region. Greater London estimated population in 2018 was more than 8 milion, the third most populous of any city in Europe, and accounts for 13.4% of the UK population.\nAnd it continues to an experience increase in population, and there\u2019s always more things to do and reasons to move there.\n\nAll of the above makes London a highly desirable city, especially among the younger population.\n"

The best way to make your transition to London easier is to choose the right neighborhood to live in. This is not an easy task, especially if you are new in the city. <br>\n\nIn Greater London, there are 32 local authority districts, (known as boroughs) which were all officially created on 1 April 1965. Out of them, 12 are part of Inner London, the other 20 are Outer London boroughs and the City of London is not classed as a London borough at all. Each of the boroughs is divided into wards. All of these neighborhoods are unique and which one is the best for you depend on your preferences.\n\n\nHowever, very often, given the far distance of London from your current place you, unfortunately, must make a descion based on the information that you can find online, without paying the visit.\n\nIn this specific situation a young couple decided to move to London, the girl is a writer and guy has an idea to start his own moving company.\nSince non of them ever visited London they are searching for a way to choose the best neighborhood for them to move. They are mainly interested in Inner London boroughs and the City of London. \n\nList of Inner London boroughs:\n1. Camden\n2. Greenwich\n3. Hackney\n4. Hammersmith and Fulham\n5. Islington\n6. Kensington and Chelsea\n7. Lambeth\n8. Lewisham\n9. Southwark\n10. Tower Hamlets\n11. Wandsworth\n12. Westminster\n\n Since their jobs are not tied to one specific location they decided to make their decision based on the following information:\n \n\n1. Safety of each ward. Where is the lowest crime rate?\n2. Employment rate.\n3. The proportion of population of working-age.\n4. Which venues are the most common in each ward? They would like to live in a neighborhood that has a good choice of restaurants and green areas.\n5. And finally the general well being of people living there. \n\n\nConsidering stated above the main goal of this project is to explore and compare London's neighborhoods and provide the best solution for this specific problem."
